I chose Python for this project, I am using python libraries such as matplotlib, numpy and seaborn. 

Data storage is handled using CSV files. CSV files are a simple and efficient way to store and share data. They are also easy to read and write using Python.

Code development is done in Jupyter notebooks. I am using Jupyter notebooks as its a convenient way to develop and document code. 

## Conclusion
